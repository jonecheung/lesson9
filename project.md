# AI Streaming Chat Application

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that enables users to interact with AI models through OpenRouter's API with real-time streaming responses. The application features a clean, intuitive interface where users can input a system prompt to define the AI's behavior, provide context for the conversation, and ask questions to receive streaming AI responses. Built with Python and Streamlit for the frontend, the app leverages Pydantic AI for robust data validation and structured API interactions, OpenRouter for accessing various AI models with streaming capabilities, and Langfuse for comprehensive logging and monitoring of AI interactions. The streaming implementation provides users with immediate feedback as the AI generates responses token by token, creating a more engaging and responsive user experience compared to traditional request-response patterns.
